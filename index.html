    <h1>A History of Surfing</h1>
    
    <!-- Introduction Section -->
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Surfing, often called the "sport of kings," has a rich and ancient history deeply rooted in Polynesian culture. 
            It is believed to have originated over 1,000 years ago in the Pacific Islands, particularly in Hawaii, where it 
            was not only a recreational activity but also a significant part of the social and spiritual life of the community. 
            In ancient Hawaii, surfing, or "he'e nalu," was a sacred practice that demonstrated one's connection to the ocean and the gods. 
            Chiefs, or ali'i, would compete to show their skill and strength, riding wooden boards up to 20 feet long, often with entire communities 
            gathering to witness these events. When Western explorers like Captain James Cook arrived in the Pacific in the 18th century, 
            they recorded their awe of the native Hawaiians' skill in navigating waves.

        <p>However, surfing saw a decline in the 19th century due to the influence of Western missionaries who disapproved of the cultural 
            significance attached to it. It wasn't until the early 20th century that surfing experienced a resurgence, largely thanks to Hawaiian 
            icons like Duke Kahanamoku, an Olympic swimmer who popularized the sport globally. Today, surfing is practiced worldwide, with modern 
            surfboards, competitions, and a lifestyle that celebrates the joy and challenge of riding the waves, but its roots remain firmly in 
            the traditions of the Pacific.</p>
